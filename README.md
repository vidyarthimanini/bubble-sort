# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

A program which allows you to visualize the Bubble Sort algorithm in action. You can generate a new dataset, change its size, and adjust the speed of the visualization.

## Live Demo

Check out the live demo of the project [here](https://sorting-algorithm.pages.dev/)

## Features

- **Generate New Array:** Create a random array of values to be sorted.
- **Adjust Array Size:** Modify the size of the array to see how algorithms handle different data sets.
- **Control Speed:** Speed up or slow down the visualization to observe the sorting process in detail.

## How to Use

1. **Generate New Array**: Click the "Generate New Array" button to create a fresh set of values.
2. **Change Array Size**: Use the slider to adjust the number of elements in the array.
3. **Adjust Speed**: Use the speed control to change the pace of the visualization.
4. **Visualize**: Watch the algorithm sort the array in real-time.

## Supported Sorting Algorithms
